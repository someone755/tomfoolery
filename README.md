# tomfoolery

This branch (mkbootimg_tools) was made to host a relatively simple script I made that helps automate building boot images and boot image flashable zips for the Sony Xperia Z3 Compact.

Along with the script are provided the tools that actually manipulate with the boot image(s), as well as example bits needed to run the script (ramdisk, zImage, device tree binary files).
